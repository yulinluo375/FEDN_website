            <h4>In May 1935, the Red Army, which went north to fight against Japan, advanced towards the heavenly danger
                of Dadu River.
                The water of Dadu River is fast flowing, both sides are high mountains and steep ridges, only a wire
                bridge can be
                passed. This bridge is the Luding Bridge, which the Red Army had to capture to go north. The Kuomintang
                reactionary sent
                two regiments to defend the Luding Bridge, blocking the Red Army to the north; later transferred two
                brigades to
                reinforce, wanting to destroy the Red Army on the bridge. Our army has long seen through the enemy's
                trick. 28th
                morning, the red four regiments received orders from their superiors: "29th morning to seize the Luding
                Bridge!" There
                were only 20 hours left, and the Fourth Red Regiment was still 240 miles away from Luding Bridge. The
                enemy's two
                brigades of reinforcements were marching across the river towards Luding Bridge. Getting ahead of the
                enemy is the key
                to our army's victory over the enemy.</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>The Fourth Red Regiment crossed the mountains and routed several groups of blocking enemies along the
                road, and by 7
                o'clock in the evening, it was still 110 miles from Luding Bridge. The soldiers did not care to eat all
                day. It was
                raining again, drenching them all. The determination to defeat the enemy made them forget hunger and
                fatigue. In the
                darkness of the night, they braved the rain and stepped on the muddy water to continue their advance.
            </h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>Suddenly countless torches appeared on the other bank, like a long snake running in the direction of
                Luding Bridge,
                clearly the enemy's reinforcements. The soldiers of the Fourth Red Regiment simply lit up torches and
                lit up the road to
                race with the enemy on the other side. The enemy saw this side of the torch, shouting at the top of his
                voice: "Which
                part are you?" Our soldiers replied in a loud voice: "I ran into the Red Army retreating." The enemy on
                the opposite
                bank was not suspicious. Like two fiery dragons, the two armies travelled twenty or thirty miles across
                the Dadu River.
                The rain fell harder and harder, like a drenching, dousing the torches on both sides of the river. The
                enemy on the
                other side of the river could not go any further and had to stop and camp. The Red Four Regiment still
                advancing in the
                dark in the rain, finally in the early morning of the 29th rushed to Luding Bridge, the reinforcement of
                the two
                brigades of the enemy left behind.</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>Luding Bridge from the water several feet high, is composed of 13 chains: two on each side, is
                considered a bridge rail;
                the bottom side by side 9, paved with wooden planks, is the bridge. People walking on the bridge
                swaying, like swinging.
                Now even the planks have been drawn off by the enemy, leaving only the chain. To look under the bridge,
                really chilling,
                reddish-brown river like a waterfall, from the upper reaches of the gorge straight down, impact on the
                rocks, splashing
                more than ten feet high waves, the sound of the waves deafening. The city of Luding on the other side of
                the bridge had
                its back to the mountains, and its west gate was facing the bridge. The two regiments of the enemy
                defending the city
                had long ago built fortifications on the walls and hillsides, and by virtue of the heavenly dangers,
                frantically shouted
                to the Red Army: "Come on, see you fly over!"</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>
                The Red Fourth Regiment immediately launched a general attack. The regimental commander and political
                commissar
                personally stood on the bridgehead to direct the battle. Buglers blew the charge horn, all weapons fired
                at once, the
                sound of gunfire, shouting and killing, all of a sudden shook the valley. The second company acted as a
                commando, 22
                heroes with short rifles, carrying sabres and grenades, braved the enemy's intensive gunfire and climbed
                the chain to
                the opposite bank. Following them was the third company, the soldiers, in addition to their weapons,
                each with a plank,
                paving the bridge as they advanced.
            </h4>
        </span>


        <span>
            <h4>The commandos had just rushed to the opposite bank when the enemy started a fire, and the bridge was
                immediately
                surrounded by flames. In the nick of time, came the shouts of the regimental commander and political
                commissar:
                "Comrades! For the cause of the Party, for the final victory, charge!" The heroes heard the Party's
                call, even more
                defiant, all arrow-like through the blazing fire, rushed into the city, and the city's enemies began a
                fierce struggle.
                After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy defending the city was eliminated most of them, and the
                rest fled in
                distress.</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>The Fourth Red Regiment bravely captured the Luding Bridge and achieved another decisive victory in the
                Long March. The
                main force of the Red Army crossed the heavenly danger of the Dadu River and marched to the front line
                of the
                anti-Japanese resistance.</h4>
