# FEDN_website
This is a site about a collection of some illustrations and articles from a Chinese Yuwen textbook. It's pixel-themed. The images have been pixelated. It also contains some simple js pixelated image effects. The site is still in development stage. This is my first personal website, so I'm putting it up for the record!
