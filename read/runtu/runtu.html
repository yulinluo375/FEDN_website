            <h4>Hanging high up in the deep, blue sky was a golden full-moon, and down below at a sandy beach by
                seaside
                was
                an
                endless
                stretch of dark-green watermelon growth.In the middle of all these was an eleven to twelve year
                old
                youngster
                wearing a
                silver ring at the neck and holding a steel pitchfork in his hand.He was stabbing hard at a
                “cha”.The
                “cha”
                twisted its
                body around and escaped from between his legs.</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>This youngster was Run Tu.When I knew him, he was only ten and some odd years old and that was
                thirty
                years
                ago.At that
                time my father was still alive, and our family was quite well off.I was a young master.That year
                it was
                our
                family's
                turn to host the annual rituals in paying homage to the clan's ancestors.I heard our turn only
                came once
                every
                thirty
                years and we were very serious about handling things right.n paying homage to likenesses of
                ancestors in
                the
                first lunar
                month, offering items were plentiful and utensils were exquisite.Many participants came to pay
                their
                respect
                and
                we had
                to guard against pilferage of offering utensils.Our family only had one seasonal worker (There
                were
                three
                types
                of
                workers in our area.Full-time workers worked for specific families all year round.Short-term
                workers
                worked
                on a
                daily
                basis.Seasonal workers grew their own crops and worked for specific families during New Year,
                festivals
                and
                rental
                collection periods).The worker was overly busy and asked my father if he could ask his son Run
                Tu to
                watch
                the
                offering
                utensils.</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>My father gave his permission.I was very happy because I had heard the name Run Tu for quite
                some time
                and
                also
                knew he
                was about my age.He was born in a leap month.Of the five fundamental elements in Chinese
                occultism he
                was
                deficient in
                earth and therefore his father called him Run Tu, which literally meant “extra earth”.He knew
                how to set
                traps
                in
                catching birds.</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>So every day I was looking forward to New Year day.When New Year arrived, Run Tu would be here
                as
                well.The
                end
                of year
                finally came, and one day my mother told me Run Tu was here.I ran over to look.He was in the
                kitchen
                with a
                purplish
                round-face, a small felt hat on his head, and a shiny silver-ring on his neck.His father loved
                him
                dearly
                and
                was afraid
                he might die early.So he made a pledge in front of Buddha and gods that he would keep him under
                control
                with
                a
                ring.He
                was generally shy with strangers but not with me.When there was nobody around, he talked to me
                and we
                got
                acquainted
                within half a day.</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>
                I didn't know what we talked about at that time.All I could remember was Run Tu was very happy
                and said
                that
                after he
                came to the city he saw many things which he had never seen before.
            </h4>
        </span>


        <span>
            <h4>The next day I wanted him to catch birds. He said:<br>
                “It doesn't work with this weather.We need a heavy snowfall.
                After snow has fallen, we would clear out a space on sandy ground.Then we would use a short
                stick to
                prop up
                a
                big
                bamboo tray and scatter some blighted grain underneath.We would watch and when birds come to
                feed, we
                would
                pull
                the
                string tied to the stick from distance and birds would be trapped in the bamboo tray.There are
                all kinds
                of
                birds, such
                as pheasant, hazel grouse, wood pigeon and blue-rump Pitta….”</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>So I wished for snowfall.</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>Run Tu also said to me:<br>

                “It's too cold now. In summer you come to our place and we will collect seashells at seaside
                during the
                day.Some
                of them
                are red and green in color.There are also small seashells nicknamed “ghost-busters” and
                “bodhisattva
                hands”.At
                night,
                Dad and I would go to guard watermelons, and you can come along.”</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>“Are you guarding against thieves?”</h4>
        </span>

        <span>
            <h4>“No. Around our place when passers-by get thirsty and pick one watermelon to eat, we do not
                consider
                that to
                be
                stealing.We are guarding against badgers, porcupines and “chas”.Under the moon when you hear
                rustling
                sounds
                then you
                know “chas” are feeding on watermelons.You grab a pitchfork and tiptoe over …”</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>At that time I didn't know what the so-called “cha” really was.Even now I still haven't found
                out.Only
                somehow I
                imagine
                it was the size of a small dog and very ferocious.
                “Would it bite people?” I asked.</h4>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>“You have the pitchfork.When you get there and see the “cha” then you jab at it.This animal is
                very
                smart.Its
                would run
                towards your direction and flee between your legs.Its fur is as slippery as oil.”</h4>
        </span>

        <span>
            <h4>All along I was unaware of all those interesting new things in this world, such as multi-colored
                seashells
                at
                seaside
                and risky adventures associated with watermelons.Before I only knew watermelons were sold in
                fruit-stores.
            </h4>
        </span>

        <span>
            <h4>“When spring tide arrives, many mudskippers just jump around in sandy ground and they have two

            </h4>
        </span>

        <span>
            <h4>Oh, in Run Tu's mind there were countless atypical things unknown to my regular friends.They
                wouldn't
                know
                certain
                matters because when Run Tu was at seaside, they had limited visions just like me in looking up
                to the
                sky
                within four
                corners of courtyards.

                cried my
                eyes
                out.He
                cried
                too and refused to leave by hiding in the kitchen.But eventually his father dragged him
                away.Afterwards
                he
                asked
                his
                father to bring to me a package of seashells and cute-looking bird feathers.I also sent him
                gifts once
                or
                twice
                but we
                never met again.</h4>
